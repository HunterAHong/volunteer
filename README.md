# Climate Connector

- Developing my original idea to connect volunteers to organizers for climate action in an authentic way. Used React framework, Java, MySQL, and REST API implementation.
- Utilized Firebase to manage user signup, profile pictures, reset password protocol, and authentication. Used Firestore for a realtime chat feature between organizers and volunteers.
- Continuing to add features until website launch.
